# Youtube-clone
In this project, I built a web application using Javascript, React.js, JWT, mongoDB that performs similar functions to youtube. User can signup/signin, upload video, like/dislike, subscribe, comment.

# Documentation/Routes
The entire documentation can be found at this link, many commands can be used in Postman

*Note*: 
1. The SignUp section, and posting comment is only available in the UI, user must do those in Postman. 
2. User must login before viewing video
3. Only "Home", "Explore", "Subscription" are fully implemented in the side. "Home" returns random videos, "Explore" returns video by views, "Subscription" returns videos that are from subscribed channels
